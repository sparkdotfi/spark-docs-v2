### Can I deposit Savings USDS or Savings DAI?

You can only deposit USDS, however you are able to convert savings tokens to USDS and deposit into the farm in a single transaction. You are therefore not able to both earn the Sky Savings Rate and earn Sky Token Rewards at the same time using the same funds.

### What are the risks?

Funds deposited into farms are not used in any liquidity pool or staking mechanism, meaning they can always be instantly withdrawn without liquidity constraints and with no fees beyond gas costs. Only the user has access to the deposited funds, ensuring complete control. As a result, there are no market or staking-related risks associated with the deposited funds.

However, the value of earned Sky token rewards may fluctuate based on the market price.
