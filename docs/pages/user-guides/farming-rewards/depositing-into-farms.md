6. If you select USDC as your deposit asset, the Transaction overview will also show the Conversion Route for USDC to USDS. Note that only USDS can be deposited, so any other asset will be converted to USDS, before being deposited. The conversion is done using non-custodial contracts by Sky and does not incur any slippage or fee beyond gas cost.
