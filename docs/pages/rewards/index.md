# Spark Rewards

## What is the Spark Rewards program?

The Spark Rewards program offers weekly token rewards to users who participate in campaigns rewarding specific actions that contribute to the growth of the Spark ecosystem. The rewards are sourced from and offered in collaboration with other DeFi projects. The goal is to bring different crypto projects together to make decentralized finance more accessible and useful for everyone.

## What are the rewards?

The rewards will mainly be tokens from partners of Spark, this being DeFi projects or companies that Spark has a partnership with. An example is the Redstone campaign, which rewards users who deposits cbBTC into the SparkLend market, which is powered by RedStone oracles.

## How often are rewards distributed?

While rewards accrue immediately, rewards are only distributed once per week on Mondays. This means you will be able to see how much you have earned in real time, but will not be able to claim until the rewards are distributed each Monday. The application will show an overview of much of the rewards are able to be claimed immediately, and what is pending the next weekly distribution.

## How do I claim the rewards?

You claim the rewards on the Spark App Rewards page. Navigate to [app.spark.fi/rewards](http://app.spark.fi/rewards) and click "Claim All‚Äù on the right hand side and follow the instructions to claim your rewards.

## Do I need to claim each week?

No, you do not have to claim rewards each week. Rewards will continue to accrue and accumulate and you can claim multiple weeks rewards in a single transaction. The application will show an overview of much of the rewards are able to be claimed immediately, and what is pending the next weekly distribution.

## Do rewards expire?

Yes, unclaimed rewards will eventually expire depending on the campaign. However there will always be a grace period between when a campaign ends and when the rewards expire of a few months, so users should have ample time to claim their rewards in time. The unclaimed rewards will be used to further reward active users of Spark.
